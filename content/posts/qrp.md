I get some flack for liking QRP `Operating the radio at low power` from many operators.**This post is for you if you choose to keep reading**. Recently I went to a local park and worked a station from Poland on just six watts. This was my first voice DX `Distance` QRP contact! The feeling was quite euphoric, I'll never forget it. While at the park I had no cell service. I pay about 50 USD a month for cell service. 

However I took a radio out of a sherpa pack and talked to a man over four thousand miles away for free. I was running the FT-817 QRP rig on it's internal battery. I have upgraded the battery from the standard SBR-32MH Ni-MH 9.V battery pack 1900 mAh into the WINDCAMP WLB-817S 3000mAh  LIPO. The LIPO is leaps and bounds ahead of the stock one.


I have only been licensed for two years so far. Operating portable has been the most rewarding so far. I do enjoy other modes and activity's I will talk about them later.

This is the nice pavilion that I operated under. The weather was perfect, about 75F.

I had no idea he was from Poland until I looked him up on QRZ. I figured he was from PR or something.

I was able to operate from this nice picnic table. I was by myself and the noise floor was next to nothing. I had a some chicken nuggets before I operated. I might make this a ritual.

Here is my mast that I used. I got the mast off eBay. It's a 7.2M telescopic fishing pole from China. It also works well for a hiking stick. I was using a 20m linked dipole configured in a inverted V. No tuner is required for the antenna that saves some weight. The clearing was just big enough for the antenna. There was plenty of shade. I was hoping to sit in the sun and work on my tan though.

Will be doing POTA and more portable soon with KE4I. I signed up for CW Academy but I have to wait on classes to start. I will post links for this on various social media platforms. I just enjoy static site generators, writing everything in Vim and having my own data.
