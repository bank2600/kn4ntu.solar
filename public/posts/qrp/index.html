                <p>I get some flack for liking QRP <code>Operating the radio at low power</code> from many operators.<strong>This post is for you if you choose to keep reading</strong>. Recently I went to a local park and worked a station from Poland on just six watts. This was my first voice DX <code>Distance</code> QRP contact! The feeling was quite euphoric, I&rsquo;ll never forget it. While at the park I had no cell service. I pay about 50 USD a month for cell service.</p>
<p>However I took a radio out of a sherpa pack and talked to a man over four thousand miles away for free. I was running the FT-817 QRP rig on it&rsquo;s internal battery. I have upgraded the battery from the standard SBR-32MH Ni-MH 9.V battery pack 1900 mAh into the WINDCAMP WLB-817S 3000mAh  LIPO. The LIPO is leaps and bounds ahead of the stock one.</p>
<p>I have only been licensed for two years so far. Operating portable has been the most rewarding so far. I do enjoy other modes and activity&rsquo;s I will talk about them later.</p>
<p><img src="/img/RM05012020QRPPoland.jpg" alt="alt text" title="Poland QRP"></p>
<p>This is the nice pavilion that I operated under. The weather was perfect, about 75F.</p>
<p><img src="/img/qrpftw.png" alt="alt text" title="Poland QRP QRZ"></p>
<p>I had no idea he was from Poland until I looked him up on QRZ. I figured he was from PR or something.</p>
<p><img src="/img/polandtable.jpg" alt="alt text" title="Table"></p>
<p>I was able to operate from this nice picnic table. I was by myself and the noise floor was next to nothing. I had a some chicken nuggets before I operated. I might make this a ritual.</p>
<p><img src="/img/mast.jpg" alt="alt text" title="Mast"></p>
<p>Here is my mast that I used. I got the mast off eBay. It&rsquo;s a 7.2M telescopic fishing pole from China. It also works well for a hiking stick. I was using a 20m linked dipole configured in a inverted V. No tuner is required for the antenna that saves some weight. The clearing was just big enough for the antenna. There was plenty of shade. I was hoping to sit in the sun and work on my tan though.</p>
<p>Will be doing POTA and more portable soon with KE4I. I signed up for CW Academy but I have to wait on classes to start. I will post links for this on various social media platforms. I just enjoy static site generators, writing everything in Vim and having my own data.</p>
