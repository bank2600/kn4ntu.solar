            <description>I get some flack for liking QRP so much. Recently I went to a local park and worked a station from Poland on just six watts. This was my first voice DX QRP contact. The feeling was quite amazing, I&amp;rsquo;ll never forget it. While at the park I had no cell service. I pay about 50 USD a month for cell service. However I took a radio out of a sherpa pack and talked to a man over four thousand miles away for free.</description>

I have upgraded the battery from the standard siCad</p>

            <description>This site will include article and information about my adventures in armature radio. I have many other hobbies that intersect with radio. We can enjoy them together. Hopefully it will help me remember things also. Some of my QRP FT8 POTA
This is a time of global pandemic. I don&amp;rsquo;t watch a lot of news about the virus. Right now I&amp;rsquo;m watching Mortal Kombat from 1997. I hope the bands get more active, from bored hams stuck at home.</description>

I hope the bands get more active, from bored hams stuck at home. I have made a lot of progress on NOT isolating myself latley. Now with this virus this is mandatory to stop the spread. Radio has been a great hobby for me these past two years. It gets me out of the house and helps me connect with people.   more activite</p>
