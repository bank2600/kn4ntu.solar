      <description>I get some flack for liking QRP Operating the radio at low power from many operators.This post is for you if you choose to keep reading. Recently I went to a local park and worked a station from Poland on just six watts. This was my first voice DX Distance QRP contact! The feeling was quite euphoric, I&amp;rsquo;ll never forget it. While at the park I had no cell service. I pay about 50 USD a month for cell service.</description>

      <description>This site will include article and information about my adventures in armature radio. I have many other hobbies that intersect with radio. We can enjoy them together. Hopefully it will help me remember things also. Some of my QRP FT8 POTA
This is a time of global pandemic. I don&amp;rsquo;t watch a lot of news about the virus. Right now I&amp;rsquo;m watching Mortal Kombat from 1997. I hope the bands get more active, from bored hams stuck at home.</description>
